# home-remote-node

This app runs on a Raspberry Pi and emits an IR signal when it receives the "send" 
command with device and action params. It loads a plain index page to trigger the
actions. This app also powers the [iOS app](https://github.com/jhulley/home-remote-ios) I built to control the same device.

You can read more about my home-remote project ... Coming soon.
